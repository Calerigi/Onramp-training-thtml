    If you are new to programming,<strong>we recommend you start at</strong> the beginning and earn these certifications in order.

    To earn each certification, build its 5 required projects and get all their tests to pass.
    
    You can add these certifications to your résué or LinkedIn. But more important than the certifications is the practice you get along the way.
    
    If you feel overwhelmed, that is normal. Programming is hard.
    
    Practice is the key. Practice, practice, practice.
    
    And this curriculum will give you thousands of hours of hands-on programming practice.
    
    And if you want to learn more math and computer science theory, we also have thousands of hours of video courses on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.
    
    If you want to get a developer job or freelance clients, programming skills will be just part of the puzzle. You also need to build your personal network and your reputation as a developer.
    
    You can do this on Twitter and GitHub, and also on the freeCodeCamp forum.
    
    Happy coding!

    Git also helps you synchronise code between multiple people. So imagine you and your
     friend are collaborating on a project. <br>You both are working on the same project files. 
     Now Git takes those changes you and your friend made independently and merges them to a 
     single “Master” repository. So by using Git you can ensure you both are working on the 
     most recent version of the repository. So you don’t have to worry about mailing your 
     files to each other and working with a ridiculous number of copies of the original file.
      And collaborating long distance becomes as easy as HTML ?.
